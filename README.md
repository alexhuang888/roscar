Build codes:

1. You need to install ROS (jade version) first.
2. You need to install OpenCV.
3. You need to install wiringPi.
4. This project folder is a full catkn workspace (not just a package.) You can get this respository, then <br/>
type <br/>
cd ~/roscar <br/>

then type <br/>
catkin_make <br/>

5. In case you just need the ROS package, it is under "roscar/src/wheels" folder.
